Smart Laptop Locker . This project is a smart locker system for storing and managing school laptops. It combines Arduino, Raspberry Pi, and a Flask web application to provide secure access via RFID cards and live monitoring of the number of laptops inside.
ðŸ”¹ Features

RFID authentication â€” students/teachers scan their card to access laptops.

Flask web interface â€” shows locker status and laptop count.

Relay-controlled door â€” locker door opens/closes automatically.

Real-time laptop tracking â€” 7 physical buttons/sensors detect how many laptops are inside.

Cancel / Take / Return actions â€” with proper redirects between pages.

ðŸ”¹ System Architecture

Arduino

Reads RFID tags.

Controls the relay (locker door).

Sends button status (7 inputs) via Serial to Raspberry Pi.

Raspberry Pi (Flask server)

Hosts the web application (Python + Flask).

Communicates with Arduino over Serial.

Manages user sessions (current RFID user, redirects, etc.).

Displays laptop count on the main page.

ðŸ”¹ Hardware Used

Raspberry Pi 4 (Flask server)

Arduino Uno (relay + RFID reader)

RC522 RFID module

Relay module (for locker door)

7 push-buttons (laptop presence detection)

12V solenoid lock (or relay-driven lock)

(Insert photos here: ![Locker Setup](images/locker.jpg))

ðŸ”¹ Software

Python 3 + Flask (web interface)

Threading (parallel Arduino communication + Flask server)

HTML/Jinja templates (for pages: index, scan, hello, take, return)

ðŸ”¹ How It Works

User scans RFID card â†’ Flask verifies UID.

Flask redirects to Scan Page â†’ then Hello Page.

User chooses action:

Take Laptop â†’ relay opens door, count decreases.

Return Laptop â†’ relay opens door, count increases.

Cancel â†’ locker stays closed, user redirected to main page.

The main page always shows the current number of laptops inside.

ðŸ”¹ Project Goals

Provide secure and simple laptop management in schools.

Prevent laptops from being lost or misplaced.

Demonstrate IoT integration of hardware + web server.

ðŸ”¹ Future Improvements

Database integration (save history of who borrowed/returned laptops).

Admin panel for user management.

Telegram/Email notifications for teachers.

More sensors (door open/close status).
